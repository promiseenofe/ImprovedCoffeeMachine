# ImprovedCoffeeMachine
This project is a much more enhanced version of the Coffee Maker program I did during the "Introduction to Software Development course" provided by Amazon. I liked the idea of the assignment project and wanted to expand on that and add a bit more complexity and realism ! I also wanted others to expand on this project and add their own favourite types of coffees like cappuccinos, matchas, mochas etc... or other features they see fit :D
Enjoy!

#How to Run the Enhanced Version
Add SQLite JDBC driver 

Ensure you have JavaFX set up in your development environment

The program will automatically create the database file ("coffee.db") on first run

The GUI provides intuitive navigation between different functions

This enhanced version demonstrates professional Java development practices while maintaining the core functionality of the original program offered in the introduction to software development Course which is a certificate offered and authorised by Amazon(AWS). 

Hopefully showed my ability to:

-Work with databases
